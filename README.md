# Autour
A highly interactive and real-time location based web application to help people find amazing places to visit around them.

## How it works?
Autour let's the users explore the places nearby to visit, work or eat. They can also add new places for a location or save their favorite places to their Bucket List if they've logged in. 

A logged in user can
  1. Add new places for a specific location.
  2. Add existing places to their Bucket list.
  3. Share their Bucket list with other users.
  4. Can choose to make their Bucket List private or public for the users that visit their profile.
  5. Approve or disapprove places added by others.
  6. Provide ratings and reviews on places added by others.

## Built on MEAN Stack
A location based NodeJS powered application built using the Express and Angular 2 web frameworks.
